## Latest Session - Assessment Engine Complete! ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸš€ MAJOR MILESTONE: ASSESSMENT ENGINE COMPLETE
- **Backend Assessment System** built with GPT-4 Vision integration
- **Skill Detection Logic** that analyzes drawing style and skill level
- **Path Assignment Algorithm** to place users in the right learning track
- **Frontend Drawing Experience** with 30-second timer and live canvas
- **Results UI** that celebrates and encourages every user

### ðŸŽ¯ KEY COMPONENTS BUILT
**Backend:**
- Assessment models and interfaces
- Skill detection service with GPT-4 Vision
- Path assignment logic and algorithms
